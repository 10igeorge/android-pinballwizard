# Pinball Wizard

## Description
Pinball Wizard is an application created to find pinball near you. You can create an account, log in, and choose your region. After selecting a region, you can search pinball by locations or machines. Interested in going to a pinball event? The FAB in the bottom right will show you upcoming events in your region. Click on a location to see all the machines that currently reside in that location. To find more information about the condition of that machine, click on it for user submitted comments.

This app was created using the Pinball Map API.
